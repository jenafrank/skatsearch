Missing features:

* Add "real" KI, make decisions based on uncertainty, extra class to track down valid random distributions (if someone does not follow suit):
      - UncertainSolve with: probability / card as return value
      - only search for win/loss here to speed up 
      - same procedures as with certain then: 
            o Normal search (real KI decision)
            o All value search (for learning tool about what to play)
            o Normal Playout (real KI run)
      - user parallelism to speed up distribution runs
      - use same TT?

* Check solve routines if they are valid for 10 tricks only or also for less and document that very well
* Document also "little" methods
* Think about API 
* Think about easy local UI that can call API perfectly (drag and drop of cards at least)

Then:

TODO: Add tests from books.
TODO: Add tests from proprietary program to check correctness.
