skatcalc search flavors.

basic: minimax algorithm.
[ab] Alpha-beta enhancement to add alpha-beta cutoffs to search tree. Highly theoretical sound.
[mr] Move reduction. Not all legal moves are considered. Certain moves are skipped
     according to equal move reduction (EMR) and unequal move reduction (UMR). The latter one
	 is based on "rank-equivalent" cards like 10-K-Q of a suit. It is combined with a 
	 brute force play-out of the current trick. If in every case the trick will be made by one
	 party, rank-equivalent cards can be skipped. E.g. considering a 10-K-Q "connection", when 
	 I play the 10 and the trick will be mine, then there is no reason to play king or queen.
[ms] Move sorting. Highly dubious and up for research. A good starting point would be to 
     sort moves with the intention to reduce branching.
[tt] Transposition table (TT). A TT is used to store results of the current state under investigation.
     In a tree search it is very likely that another path in the tree will yield to the same state.
	 Then, we already have the result at hand. Very common technique. Albeit error-prone.
[qs] Quasi-symmetrics according to Kupferschmid. Published technique.
[cb] CTBRE. A new technique. We use the current tree path that comes back from its leaf. If
     the trick in the current path will be won, then we can skip "rank-equivalent" cards.
	 The reasoning is the same as in [mr]. However, here, we do not use additional brute force
	 forward calculation to determine if in every case the trick will be made by one party.
	 Instead, we use the "real" back-propagated trick-won value to skip moves in the current
	 node and therefore reduce branching. E.g. if I calculated the 10-card-branch and the 
	 back propagated value ensures that I have won the trick, then I do not need to calculate
	 the K-branch or Q-branch.
