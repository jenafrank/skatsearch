Interface for outside call:

Command line call:
  * system.json => System parameters like size of transposition table
  * input.json => For building problem => Implement parsing in both Creation assistants
  * output.json => Export results

Problem Solver
  * Creation assistant: ProblemBuilder class
  * Information carrier: Problem class
  * Algorithm carrier: Solver class

Uncertain Problem Solver
  * Creation assistant: UncertainProblemBuilder class
  * Information carrier: UncertainProblem class
  * Algorithm carrier: Estimator class

* Document also "little" methods
* Think about easy local UI that can call API perfectly (drag and drop of cards at least)

Then:

TODO: Add tests from books.
TODO: Add tests from proprietary program to check correctness.
